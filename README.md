1) the first code implements the A* Search Algorithm in Python to find the shortest path in a 2D grid while avoiding obstacles (rivers). The program takes user input for the grid, start, and goal positions, computes the optimal path, and visualizes it step by step using Tkinter GUI.
2) The second code  implements a simple Chess AI using the Minimax algorithm with a basic material evaluation function. The program lets you play against the AI in the console by entering moves in UCI format
3) the third code implements Tic-Tac-Toe game in C++ where you can play against an AI powered by the Minimax algorithm. The program lets you choose whether the AI plays as X (starting first) or O, and ensures optimal moves throughout the game.
